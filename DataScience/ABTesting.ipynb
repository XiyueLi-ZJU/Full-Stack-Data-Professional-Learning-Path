    "A/B testing is a controlled experiment methodology that compares two versions of a product or feature and determines which performs better. Here we use **ðŸŒ±Sqaure Meter GardeningðŸŒ±** project as an example to show how to perform A/B testing and use its results to improve business performance. Suppose we want to improve our website design to attract users to place orders. We want to test the effectiveness of two different versions of our website page layout in terms of <font color='blue'>conversion rate</font> - the rate at which visitors place an order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version A**: The original page layout we are currently using where the \"Order Now\" button is located at the bottom of the page after all product details and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version B**: A new page layout we plan to implement where the \"Order Now\" button is located in the upper right corner of the website's main page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Moving the \"Order Now\" button higher will lead to a higher conversion rate because it makes it more convenient for users to place an order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Version B shows a statistically significant increase in conversion rates compared to Version A, the project team will implement the change. However, if there are no significant differences or Version B performs worse, the project team will continue to use the original layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup: Divide the website traffic randomly into two groups: one group with Version A (the control group), and the other group with Version B (the experimental group).\n",
    "2. The project team will run the test for one month to collect sufficient data points. \n",
    "3. Metrics: conversion rate - the rate at which website visitors place an order\n",
    "4. Data collection - Check where user interactions are logged and set up data pipelines to extract the required data from log files.\n",
    "5. Analysis: After the testing period, compare the conversion rates between Version A and Version B and determine if there is a significant difference.\n",
    "6. Implementation: Based on the results of the A/B testing, we can implement the winning version as the new website layout and <font color='red'>continuously monitor</font> the performance. "
