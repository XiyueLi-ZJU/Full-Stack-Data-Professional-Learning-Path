    "A data analyst's daily tasks include collecting, organizing, and analyzing data, developing models, and reporting. To effectively support decision-making, data analysts not only need to master statistical knowledge and technical skills, but also need to be familiar with industry knowledge and understand the company's business."

    "Statistics servers as the backbone for data analysis. [Descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics) provide a quantitative summary of the main characteristics of the dataset using measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation.  [Inferential statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) make inferences and generalizations about a population based on sample data. [Statistics Modelling](https://www.coursera.org/articles/statistical-modeling) uses assumptions and mathematical models to identify patterns, understand relationship between variables, and makes predictions or perform classifications. Controlled Experiment is often used to measure the effects of a change or interference. For example, assess the impact of changing one feature of a product.

    "**How to learn Programming?** There are many tutorials available online. I believe the best way to learn a programming language is to find a tutorial and follow it step by step. Do not skip any part. A seemingly trivial process during learning may have a significant impact later on in a real project, for example, reducing data processing time by 10 times. In the meantime, find a project that you are interested in and complete it. Interest is the best teacher. Enjoy the project and present it to others when you are ready. "
